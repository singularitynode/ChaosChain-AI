## 🌌 Overview

**ChaosChain-AI** is a **next-generation AI-driven supply chain control tower simulator**.  

It combines chaotic demand modeling, predictive Monte Carlo simulations, multi-factor risk scoring, and automated mitigation actions. Designed for **research, experimentation, and adaptive supply chain management**, it demonstrates the **full power of AI orchestration in complex, uncertain environments**.

Key capabilities include:

- Real-time monitoring of multiple supply chain locations  
- Integration of weather, social media, logistics, and supplier risk factors  
- Advanced inventory management with lead times and safety stock  
- Automated response to high-risk scenarios with actionable interventions  
- Interactive visual dashboards for decision-making and risk tracking

## 🔥 Full Feature Set

### 1. **Chaotic Demand Generation**
- Logistic map-based demand models per product category  
- Noise-injected realism to simulate volatile market behavior  
- Volatility tracking to feed risk calculations  

### 2. **Monte Carlo Predictive Engine**
- Hundreds of simulations per cycle for forecast confidence  
- Incorporates social media influence, stochastic variability, and external factors  
- Generates forecast distributions, confidence intervals, and risk-adjusted demand  

### 3. **Inventory System with Lead Times**
- Multi-category inventory tracking with thread-safe operations  
- Incoming shipments processed per configurable lead times  
- Tracks in-transit and available inventory  

### 4. **Risk Assessment Engine**
- Combines inventory levels, forecast uncertainty, volatility, and external factors  
- Assigns multi-level risk scores: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL  
- Captures demand, weather, logistics, and supplier risks  

### 5. **Action Engine**
- Automated inventory ordering when risk thresholds are breached  
- Activates contingency plans for weather or logistics disruptions  
- Diversifies suppliers or adjusts safety stock dynamically  

### 6. **AI Control Tower**
- Monitors multiple locations concurrently  
- Maintains detailed histories of inventory, risks, actions, and alerts  
- Calculates service levels and provides actionable insights  

### 7. **Interactive Dashboards**
- Inventory levels per category over simulation cycles  
- Risk evolution over time  
- Alert summaries for recent critical mitigations or pending risks  
- Plotly-based visualization for GUI or Jupyter integration

🔧 Potential Enhancements
-------------------------
ChaosChain-AI can be extended with advanced features without touching the core simulation:

1. **Machine learning for parameter optimization**  
   - Random Forest or other models for dynamic tuning  
   - Located in `enhancements.py`

2. **Statistical anomaly detection for demand patterns**  
   - Detect unusual demand spikes or drops  
   - Non-intrusive, experimental (`enhancements.py`)

3. **Adaptive Monte Carlo parameters based on historical performance**  

4. **Integration with real-world predictive data sources**
